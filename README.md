Unfinished Windows Keylogger


Please help. 
Keylogger works, Windows Service works, Combination doesn't work.


Found out it doesn't work due to it not beeing allowed to be attached to the Desktop.
So this wont work, unfortunately I am about 5 years too late for this.
Im going to try and do this indirectly, I think it should work if the service just calls another application that is able to interact with the user.
