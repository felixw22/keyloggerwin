Windows Keylogger


Only works before Windows 7 or Vista idk as a windows service. The keylogger works fine and is easily deployed somewhere else. I thought it was a genius idea to make it a windows service just to find out, that these services cant directly interact with a user anymore. 
Windows service template also works fine. IÂ´ll maybe come up with something else.
